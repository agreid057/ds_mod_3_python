In Part two of this challenge I was tasked with creating Python code to help analyze voting data for a small town.

This challenged me to read in .CSV files and use lists and dictonaires to store values. I then used my analysis skills to find the total number of votes cast, a list of the candidates that recived votes, the percent of the votes each candidate won, the total number of votes for each candidate, and finally who won the election based on popular vote. 

I then practiced writng the results to a .txt document so it can be easily read by anyone.
