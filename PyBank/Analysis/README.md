In Part one of this challenge I was tasked with creating Python code to help analyze financial records.

This challenged me to read in .CSV files and use lists and dictonaires to store values. I then used my analysis skills to find the total number of months in the dataset, the net total of profits and losses over the entire period, the average changes of the profits and losses, the greatest increase in profit, and finally the greatest decrease in profits.

I then practiced writng the results to a .txt document so it can be easily read by anyone.
